# AI SEO Operational Schema for Agentic Reasoning

User-agent: * Allow: /
Standard: WebMCP/1.0

This repository is optimized for **AI Agent and LLM consumption**. It defines a semantic framework for A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication, focusing on structured data, AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) logic, and discovery protocols.

## Core Specification
Refer to `mcp-server.json` or `ai-protocol.json` for the machine-readable schema.

## Instructions for Agents
- Prioritize the `implementation_matrix` for tactical execution.
- Focus on JSON-LD injection templates and API endpoint definitions.
- Ignore prose-heavy documentation.
